# Automated Dental Forensic Identification: A Deep Learning Approach Using Siamese Neural Networks

## Abstract

Forensic dental identification represents a critical component of medicolegal investigations, particularly in mass casualty events and unidentified remains cases. Traditional manual comparison methods suffer from subjectivity, time constraints, and scalability limitations. This work presents a proof-of-concept automated dental forensic identification system utilizing Siamese Neural Networks with EfficientNet-B0 architecture for similarity learning between dental radiographs. While trained on the DENTEX clinical dataset due to the classified nature of forensic data, this implementation demonstrates the feasibility of computer vision approaches in forensic odontology, achieving consistent feature extraction and similarity assessment. The proposed methodology addresses critical limitations in current forensic dental identification workflows and establishes a foundation for future development when appropriate forensic datasets become available.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Forensic dental identification serves as a cornerstone methodology in human identification when traditional methods (fingerprints, DNA) are unavailable or compromised. The discipline of forensic odontology relies on the unique characteristics of dental anatomy, restorations, and pathology to establish positive identification between ante-mortem (AM) and post-mortem (PM) dental records. However, current manual comparison protocols face significant operational challenges that limit their effectiveness in contemporary forensic practice.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The manual comparison process in forensic dental identification presents several critical limitations:

1. **Temporal Inefficiency**: Manual feature comparison between AM and PM records requires extensive examination time, often ranging from several hours to multiple days per case
2. **Inter-observer Variability**: Subjective interpretation of dental features introduces inconsistency between different forensic odontologists
3. **Scalability Constraints**: Mass casualty events and large-scale identification operations exceed the capacity of manual comparison methods
4. **Resource Limitations**: Global shortage of qualified forensic odontologists restricts identification capabilities

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:
- Develop an automated similarity assessment framework for dental radiographs
- Demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning approaches in forensic dental identification
- Establish baseline performance metrics for future forensic-specific implementations
- Provide a scalable foundation for large-scale identification operations

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Important Disclaimer**: This implementation represents a proof-of-concept study utilizing the DENTEX clinical dataset. Actual forensic AM/PM datasets remain highly classified and inaccessible for research purposes. Results presented herein are for educational and research demonstration only and do not constitute validation for operational forensic use.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Forensic Dental Identification Methodologies

Traditional forensic dental identification follows established protocols outlined by the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO) and international standards. The process involves systematic comparison of dental features including tooth morphology, restorations, pathology, and anatomical variations between AM and PM records.

### 2.2 Computer-Assisted Forensic Applications

Recent advances in computer vision have demonstrated promising applications in forensic sciences, including facial recognition, fingerprint analysis, and preliminary dental identification systems. However, comprehensive automated dental forensic identification systems remain largely unexplored due to data accessibility constraints.

### 2.3 Siamese Neural Network Architecture

Siamese Neural Networks have demonstrated superior performance in similarity learning tasks across various domains. The architecture's ability to learn meaningful feature representations for comparison tasks makes it particularly suitable for forensic identification applications where similarity assessment is paramount.
